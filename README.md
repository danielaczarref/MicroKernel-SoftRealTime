# Real Time System of a Embedded System Project using MicroKernel Soft Real Time architecture


## Project description

Temperature, humidity and sound measurement for an alarm system;


### Components
- Arduino UNO;
- Protoboard;
- Jumpers;
- Resistors;
- USB;
- LED RGB 5 mm;
- Buzzer;
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor;
- Sound sensor.


### Rules

1. if temperature or umidity is nan: LED is white;
2. if temperature > 35 || temperature < 15: LED is red;
3. if temperature > 30 || temperature < 20: LED is blue;
4. else: LED is green.
